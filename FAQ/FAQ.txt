6)There is a confusion using company ID or the flag in your application, please find the below response from KUSH and do the needful
Let me know if you have any questions

Kush’s Response:
The flag control should only be used in situations where we operate in one company at a time similar to Sage 500. For reports/applications that span multiple companies can use radio buttons/checkbox lists. I don’t think drop down is a good UI/UX control for something less than 5 options.
